# ML-MOOC-NPTEL
This repository contains the Tutorials for the NPTEL MOOC on Machine Learning.

## Pro Tip:
Thanks to Google, you can run these notebooks directly on Google Collaboratory using (FREE!!) CPU/GPU/TPU runtimes by replacing `https://github.com` in the URL by `https://colab.research.google.com/github/`. No local installation of Python is required. More detailed instructions are avilable at this [link](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb#scrollTo=K-NVg7RjyeTk). Enjoy!

## PS:
